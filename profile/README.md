## What Is ArdraShop?

Ardrashop is an initiative to lend a hand of support to Indian trivial artists who create handmade products such as sculptures, handwoven fabrics, pottery, etc. We aim to encourage the made-in-India campaign and include the touch of Indian culture in your lives by introducing some nifty commodities made with love by our very own creators. We extend a direction to the people belonging to rural areas who create artistic products but don't get to showcase their skills. At ardrashop, such underrated gifted people get the opportunity to sell their products in metropolitan cities and display their art worldwide. True charity begins with providing employment. Let's contribute and lend our support to these underprivileged individuals who deserve better. Let's make their hard work fruitful and bring home the joy of Indian traditions and cultures.

A step towards making India a self-reliant country. We, at ardrashop, connect our customers to the ethnic self-made Indian sellers who create beautiful products that are exclusively made in India. At ardrashop, we intend to provide an international market to our Indian culture, thus redefining India with new manufacturing potentials.
